RmEDir 1.0 2018.01.19

RmEDir is a small command line utility which allows you to recursively delete all empty subdirectories from the specified directory.
By default, the program also deletes empty directories with the Read-only, System and Hidden attributes (on Windows system), but you can disable it with the --keep-special-dirs switch.
The program has no built-in file deletion function, so you can be sure that no file will be deleted by accident.
RmEDir supports network directories and paths exceeding the MAX_PATH (260) character limit.
